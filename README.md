# Robotics_Software_Engineer
A repository for all the projects on Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer nanodegree coded in C++.
1) First project contains a custom built world with two robots running via Gazebo plugins.
2) Second project contains ros nodes that find a white ball in the world and drive the robot towards it. To run this project, clone the go_chase_it folder, and run "catkin_make" command in it. Then, run "source devel/setup.bash" in two terminals. Then, enter "roslaunch my_robot world.launch" and "roslaunch ball_chaser ball_chaser.launch". Move the white ball anywhere in front of the bot to make it move.
3) Third project contains ROS nodes that run the Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm on the robot and the world build in previous projects. To run the project, clone the project, go inside catkin_ws folder and run "catkin_make". Then, in two terminals, run "roslaunch my_robot world.launch" and "roslaunch my_robot acml.launch". Finally, use the 2D Nav Goal in Rviz to set a goal and see the robot localize itself using Particle Filter.

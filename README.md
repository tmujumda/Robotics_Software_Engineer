# Robotics_Software_Engineer
A repository for all the projects on Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer nanodegree.
1) First project contains a custom built world with two robots running via Gazebo plugins.
2) Second project contains ros nodes that find a white ball in the world and drive the robot towards it. To run this project, clone the go_chase_it folder, and run "catkin_make" command in it. Then, run "source devel/setup.bash" in two terminals. Then, enter "roslaunch my_robot world.launch" and "roslaunch ball_chaser ball_chaser.launch". Move the white ball anywhere in front of the bot to make it move.
